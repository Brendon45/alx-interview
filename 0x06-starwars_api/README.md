# 0x06. Star Wars API

## Algorithm

## API

## JavaScript

The “0. Star Wars Characters” project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. To successfully complete this project, you need to be familiar with several key concepts related to web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Concepts Needed:

1. __HTTP Requests in JavaScript__:

     - Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using the `request` module or alternatives like `fetch` in Node.js.
      - [A Complete Guide to Making HTTP Requests in Node.js](https://www.memberstack.com/blog/node-http-request)

2. __Working with APIs__:

     - Understanding the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.
     - Parsing JSON data returned by APIs.

3. __Asynchronous Programming__:

     - Managing asynchronous operations with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
     - Handling API response data asynchronously.
     - [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

4. __Command Line Arguments in Node.js__:

     - Using the process.argv array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.
     - [How to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-parse-command-line-arguments-in-nodejs/)
  
5. __Array Manipulation and Iteration__:

    - Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures to format and display character names.
    - [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
  
By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and resources, you will be able to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API, demonstrating your ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.
