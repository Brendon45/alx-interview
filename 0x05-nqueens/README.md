# 0x05. N Queens

## Algorithm

## Python

The `‚Äú0x05. N queens‚Äù` project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N√óN chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

### Concepts Needed:

1. __Backtracking Algorithms:__

   - Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
   - [Backtracking Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-backtracking-2/)
  
2. __Recursion:__

    - Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
    - [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
  
3. __List Manipulations in Python:__

    - Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
    - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
  
4. __Python Command Line Arguments:__

    - Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
    - [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)
  
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N√óN chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

- Usage: `nqueens N`
    - If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print `Usage: nqueens N`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `1`
- where N must be an integer greater or equal to `4`
    - If N is not an integer, print `N must be a number`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    - If N is smaller than `4`, print `N must be at least 4`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `1`
- The program should print every possible solution to the problem
    - One solution per line
    - Format: see example
    - You don‚Äôt have to print the solutions in a specific order
- You are only allowed to import the `sys` module
