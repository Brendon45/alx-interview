# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Algorithm

## Python

For the “0x04. UTF-8 Validation” project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

### Concepts Needed:

1. __Bitwise Operations in Python:__

    - Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
    - Python Bitwise Operators
